# About Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the 'train.csv' dataset from the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition. The project is implemented using PySpark on Google Colab.

## Contents of this Repository

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and data preprocessing for modeling.

2. **Classification Algorithms Considered**:
   - Implementing various classification algorithms using PySpark MLlib, such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Fine-tuning model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Evaluating and comparing the performance of different classification models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction of Titanic Passenger Survival**:
   - Building the final predictive model using the best-performing algorithm.
   - Generating predictions for survival of Titanic passengers using the test dataset.
